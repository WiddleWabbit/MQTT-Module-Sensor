# Sensor module firmware

The sensor daughter is one module. `src/main.cpp` constructs the TWI
adapter and the link, and calls `update()`. It does not run the steps
inside the link.

## How the firmware runs

Each of these is a short page: what that part creates, and what one
pass does.

1. [Architecture](architecture.md) — the loop, and who owns whom.
2. [Module link](module-link.md) — the MOD gate, then one master write.
3. [Slave port](slave-port.md) — TWI1 on the AVR, and the desktop fake.

## When you need a byte, a state, or a test

The [reference index](reference/index.md) is the lookup. Each page
there has the states, the sequences, the errors, and the desktop test
that covers them.

## Wire contract

`lib/Interfaces/ModuleProtocol.h` is the copy of the motherboard
header. Frame layout, CRC-8/SMBus, command bytes, `kModGateMaxMs`, and
`kClockStretchMaxMs` live there. If a page in this tree and that header
disagree, the header wins. Change the motherboard header, then copy it
here.

This tree documents the slave. The motherboard's master sequences stay
in the motherboard firmware.
